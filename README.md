var OnionSkin = require('onionskin');

// Initialize a pool
var pool = new OnionSkin();

pool.get('my/key/path', function (err) {
  // Data is either inexistent or expired
  return slowFuncThatReturnsPromise();
}).then(function (value) {
  // The value that was either on cache or was just generated
  console.log(value);
});

## Changelog

### 1.0.1
* The function to generate missing cache should be passed as the last parameter to `pool.get`, although generating cache `Promise.catch` is still supported the cache will never be unlocked if `item.save` or `item.set` are not called.
* Also when the cache generator function is passed as parameter, there is no need to call either `item.save` or `item.set`, just return the value you want to be cached and it will automatically saved and passed along to the promise chain.
